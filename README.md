## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **MongoDB**: Install MongoDB on your local machine or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alok3k7/Office-Management-API.git
   cd office_management_api
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS and Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Environment Configuration

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project with the following contents:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_DB_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/office_management_db"
   HOST="127.0.0.1"
   PORT=8000
   DEBUG=True
   ```
   - Adjust `MONGO_DB_URL` if you're using a cloud-based MongoDB service.

## Running the API

To start the API, execute the following command:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

- The `--reload` option enables auto-reload so the server restarts upon code changes.

## API Documentation

You can access the API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI at:  
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`  

This documentation provides an interactive interface for testing API endpoints.
